#  CSD Pool Miner - all-in-one installer for Ubuntu / Linux.
#  Run it. It will:
#    1. Detect your GPU (NVIDIA / AMD) or fall back to CPU.
#    2. Download the matching prebuilt miner from GitHub Releases.
#    3. Ask for your addr20 payout address once (and remember it).
#    4. Start mining to the pool.
#  Override detection:  ./install-csd-miner.sh nvidia|amd|cpu
#  GPU DRIVERS ARE NOT INSTALLED HERE - the GPU builds need your
#  vendor driver/runtime already present; otherwise use the cpu build.
#
#  Running via  curl ... | bash  (no terminal)? There is no TTY to
#  prompt on, so pass your address in the environment:
#     curl -fsSL <url> | CSD_ADDR=<addr20> bash
#  or as the second argument:  ... | bash -s -- <variant> <addr20>
